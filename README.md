# Task Allocation for a Multi-Robot System using RRT* Algorithm
**The code has:**
- Added functionalities to generate random obstacles.
- Obsatcle avoidance logic.
- A cost function comparison to check which robot is better for the task involved.

**The code implements simplified robot models based on:**
